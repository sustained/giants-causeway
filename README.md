# giants-causeway

This is just a fancy background for [my website](https://sustained.name/). With hexagons and colours and animation and such.

It wouldn't have been possible without [this resource](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#conversions).

The name is a reference to the [Giant's Causeway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant%27s_Causeway) in Northern Ireland, which is a large area of mostly hexagonal-ish basalt columns.
